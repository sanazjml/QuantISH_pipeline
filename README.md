# QuantISH_pipeline

This repository contains the image analysis pipeline introduced in paper “QuantISH: RNA in situ hybridization image analysis pipeline to quantify cell type-specific target RNA expression and variability in tissue samples”.

QuantISH is a comprehensive image analysis pipeline for RNA in situ hybridization images which quantifies target RNAs in individual cells and patients. The pipeline is capable of quantifying chromogenic (or immunofluorescence) and Tissue Microarray (TMA) or Whole Slide images efficiently. For full documentaion of TMA quantification, please check https://github.com/sanazjml/QuantISH_pipeline/tree/main/TMA-CISH. Also, whole slide quantification is well documented in https://github.com/sanazjml/QuantISH_pipeline/tree/main/Whole%20Slide-FISH .
